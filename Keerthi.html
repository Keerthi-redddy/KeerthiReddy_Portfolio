                <div class ='project-box'><strong>Healthcare Premium Prediction: <a href='ml_premium_prediction.html'>Model Link</a> | <a href='ml_premium_prediction_rest.html'>specialized model Link</a></strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Developed a Healthcare Premium Prediction model to forecast healthcare premiums based on key demographic (age, income) and health-related features 
                            (medical history, conditions like diabetes, heart disease). The model used a risk score system to quantify how various health conditions impact 
                            premium costs, enabling more accurate and personalized insurance pricing.</li>

                        <li>Applied multiple machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and XGBoost, to analyze the data. The Linear Regression model achieved
                             an R-squared value of 0.93, demonstrating good predictive accuracy for most individuals across the dataset.</li>

                        <li>Developed a specialized model for individuals under 25 years old using XGBoost, which resulted in an exceptional R-squared value of 0.997. This tailored model 
                            highlighted that younger individuals showed more extreme prediction errors, emphasizing the importance of segment-specific models for more accurate forecasting.</li>

                        <li>The analysis revealed that a one-size-fits-all approach to premium prediction leads to inaccuracies, particularly for younger populations. The results underscored 
                            the benefits of personalized models to optimize insurance pricing and improve risk management strategies, offering more accurate, data-driven insights for the insurance industry.</li>
                        </ul>

                <div class ='project-box'><strong>Credit Risk Model: <a href='credit_risk_model.html'>Click Here to View</a></strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>In this project, I developed a Credit Risk Modeling system aimed at predicting the probability of loan defaults based on an individual’s financial history. 
                    This is a critical application for financial institutions to evaluate the risk of lending and make data-driven decisions. The primary objective was to classify borrowers into risk categories (low, medium, and high)
                     and identify key factors influencing the likelihood of default.</li>

                    <li>To ensure the model's robustness, we used a range of machine learning techniques such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. The scope of the project involved performing a train-test split early in 
                        the process to prevent data leakage and ensure unbiased results during exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering. The analysis leveraged historical credit data, including variables like income, loan
                         type, and repayment history. We employed performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, AUC, and the Gini coefficient to evaluate the model’s effectiveness.</li>

                    <li>During the model training process, multiple attempts were made to handle class imbalance using techniques like under-sampling and SMOTE Tomek, alongside hyperparameter tuning through Optuna. The model’s effectiveness
                         was further assessed using the KS Statistic, AUC, and Gini coefficient. The results showed that the model was particularly effective in distinguishing between high-risk and low-risk borrowers, achieving an AUC of 0.98
                          and a Gini coefficient of 0.96, which is indicative of nearly perfect predictive power.</li>

                    <li>Additionally, insights gained from the analysis revealed that variables like loan tenure, delinquent months, total past due (DPD), and credit utilization are strong predictors of default risk. However, factors such as loan
                         amount and income did not show strong predictive power individually but may be better understood through the loan-to-income ratio (LTI), an area explored further during the analysis. Ultimately, the model’s high performance,
                          especially in the top deciles, illustrates its potential for real-world application in credit risk assessment, providing financial institutions with valuable insights to minimize loan default risk.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>In this project, I designed a comprehensive multi-view dashboard in Power BI for AtliQ Hardware, focusing on six key departments: sales, finance, supply chain, executive, marketing, and products. The goal was to
                                 provide valuable insights into sales trends and business operations to help facilitate data-driven decision-making, with the aim of scaling business processes by 10%.</li>

                            <li>I integrated two different data sources—MySQL and Excel—containing over 1 million records, and performed data modeling to ensure seamless integration and accurate reporting. The dashboard was designed to present
                                 the most relevant KPIs and metrics for each department, offering real-time insights into performance, inventory management, financial trends, and customer behavior.</li>

                            <li>To optimize the performance of the report, I utilized DAX Studio to fine-tune the calculations and improve query performance. This optimization effort resulted in a 30% reduction in storage usage and a 10% 
                                improvement in report load times, enhancing the overall efficiency and user experience of the dashboard.</li>

                            <li>This project demonstrates my ability to work with large datasets, build interactive and user-friendly dashboards, and implement performance improvements that directly impact business outcomes.</li>
